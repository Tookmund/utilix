Utilix
======

A set of POSIX-inspired utilities

The idea is to rethink how these utilities work and how they can be made to
work better.

*N.B. These are not POSIX-compliant and are not intended to be*

These are intended to be a replacement base system for any POSIX-based system
but will not be compliant with the POSIX standard by default. Wrappers will
be considered, but I won't be writing any.
